## Steps

* Set up a Rust project: In your project directory, run `cargo init` to create a new Rust project.

* Install the required dependencies: To interact with the Spotify Web API, you will need to install the `reqwest` and `serde_json` dependencies. You can add them to your Cargo.toml file:
```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

* Authenticate with the API: To access the Spotify Web API, you will need to authenticate with an access token. You can obtain an access token by following the steps in the Spotify Web API documentation.

    - Go to the Spotify for Developers website (https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

    - Click the "Log in" button at the top-right of the page and sign in with your Spotify account.

    - Click the "Dashboard" button at the top-right of the page.

    - Click the "Create an App" button and fill in the required information.

    - Once you have created your app, you will be redirected to the app dashboard. Click the "Edit Settings" button and add a "Redirect URI" (this can be any URL on your local machine, such as http://localhost:8888/callback).

    - Note down the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" values from the app dashboard, as you will need these to authenticate with the Spotify Web API.

    - To obtain an access token, you will need to make a POST request to the Spotify Web API's token endpoint. Here's an example using the reqwest Rust library:

    ```Rust
    use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

    #[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
    struct AccessTokenResponse {
        access_token: String,
        token_type: String,
        expires_in: u32,
    }

    fn get_access_token(client_id: &str, client_secret: &str) ->   Result<String, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        let client = reqwest::blocking::Client::new();
        let body = "grant_type=client_credentials";
        let basic_auth = base64::encode(format!("{}:{}", client_id, client_secret));

        let response = client.post("https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token")
        .header(reqwest::header::AUTHORIZATION, format!("Basic {}", basic_auth))
        .header(reqwest::header::CONTENT_TYPE, "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
        .body(body)
        .send()?
        .json::<AccessTokenResponse>()?;

        Ok(response.access_token)
    }
    ```

    - To use this function, you can call it like this:
    ```Rust
    fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        let client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";
        let client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET";
        let access_token = get_access_token(client_id, client_secret)?;

        println!("Access token: {}", access_token);

        Ok(())
    }
    ```

    - Note that access tokens are short-lived and will need to be refreshed periodically.

* Make a request to the API: Once you have an access token, you can make a request to the Spotify Web API to retrieve music data related to the theme. For example, to retrieve a list of recommended tracks for a given genre, you can make a GET request to the https://api.spotify.com/v1/recommendations endpoint with the seed_genres parameter set to the desired genre. Here's an example:

```Rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct RecommendationResponse {
    tracks: Vec<Track>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Track {
    name: String,
    artists: Vec<Artist>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Artist {
    name: String,
}

fn get_recommendations(access_token: &str, genre: &str) -> Result<Vec<Track>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let client = reqwest::blocking::Client::new();
    let mut headers = reqwest::header::HeaderMap::new();
    headers.insert(reqwest::header::AUTHORIZATION, format!("Bearer {}", access_token).parse().unwrap());

    let response = client.get("https://api.spotify.com/v1/recommendations")
        .header(headers)
        .query(&[("seed_genres", genre)])
        .send()?
        .json::<RecommendationResponse>()?;

    Ok(response.tracks)
}
```

This function takes an access token and a genre as input and returns a list of recommended tracks. The serde library is used to deserialize the JSON response from the API into Rust structs.

* Display the recommended music: Once you have retrieved the list of recommended tracks, you can display them in your Rust application. You can use the println! macro to display the tracks. Here's an example:

```Rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";
    let genre = "chill";
    let recommendations = get_recommendations(access_token, genre)?;

    println!("Recommended tracks for {}: ", genre);
    for (i, track) in recommendations.iter().enumerate() {
        // The enumerate function is used to number the tracks. 
        println!("{}. {} - {}", i + 1, track.name, track.artists[0].name);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```
