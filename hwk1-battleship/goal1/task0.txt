Goal 1: Minimal end to end system
---------------------------------
//Task 0. Project Setup
  You should already have your development environment setup from the previous tutorial.
  We need to make a new gitlab project and create the build.gradle.
  Go to Duke's gitlab, create a new project named
    ece651-spYEAR-YOURNETID-battleship
  [replace YEAR with 2 digits for the current year]
  [replace YOURNETID with your netid]
  Now clone that project to your computer.
  cd into that directory (cd ece651-spYEAR-YOURNETID-battleship)
  and do
  gradle init.

Do the gradle setup as you did in the dev-setup walkthrough, except
specify the project name and default source package

Project name (default: src): battleship
Source package (default: battleship): edu.duke.YOURNETID.battleship

Copy in the top-level build.gradle, and edit app/build.gradle as in
the dev-setup walkthrough.




Before you proceed, run

./gradlew  dependencies

We aren't so much interested in the output, but it will make sure your build.gradle file
is valid, and check the dependency structure.  This mostly will help you identify any problems
before you proceed.
